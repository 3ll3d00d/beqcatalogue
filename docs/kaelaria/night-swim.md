Forced into early retirement by a degenerative illness, former baseball player Ray Waller moves into a new house with his wife and two children. Secretly hoping, against the odds, to return to pro ball, Ray persuades Eve that the new home’s shimmering backyard swimming pool will be fun for the kids and provide physical therapy for him.
