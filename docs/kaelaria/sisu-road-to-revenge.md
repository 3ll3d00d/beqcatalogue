Returning to the house where his family was brutally murdered during the war, 'the man who refuses to die' dismantles it, loads it on a truck, and is determined to rebuild it somewhere safe in their honor. When the Red Army commander who killed his family comes back hellbent on finishing the job, a relentless, eye-popping cross-country chase ensues — a fight to the death.
