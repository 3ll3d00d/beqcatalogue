# The Remains of the Day

## Atmos, DTS-HD MA 7.1

**1993 • PG • 2h 14m • Drama, Romance • kaelaria**

A rule bound head butler's world of manners and decorum in the household he maintains is tested by the arrival of a housekeeper who falls in love with him in post-WWI Britain. The possibility of romance and his master's cultivation of ties with the Nazi cause challenge his carefully maintained veneer of servitude.
