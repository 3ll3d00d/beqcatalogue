BEQ note: The Oblivion Atmos remaster incurred an approximate 80Hz -3dB LS filter from the original DTS-HD MA 7.1 master.  The goal of this BEQ is to restore the bass of the Atmos soundtrack to the original form of the DTS-HD MA 7.1 master.  If you prefer a different approach that BEQs the Atmos remastered soundtrack with the studio applied 80Hz -3dB LS filter, then please use one of the other two available BEQ options from either author aron7awol or mobe1969.  Thank you.
