Together, they will face threatening new villains, encounter colorful adversaries, embark on thrilling adventures, and become heroes with the power to ignite a rebellion.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 10:28:59 -0000</pubDate><category>TV</category><category>mobe1969</category><guid isPermaLink="false">2c0156f6d40d5b076f70a3d19de00ce0d72eeaf3e4129dfa320e28e51ac01135</guid></item><item><title>Yakitori: Soldiers of Misfortune</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mobe1969/yakitori-soldiers-of-misfortune/#season-1</link><description>With Earth colonized by a superior alien civilization, Akira's only chance at a better future is to enlist as an expendable Yakitori foot soldier.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 10:28:59 -0000</pubDate><category>TV</category><category>mobe1969</category><guid isPermaLink="false">9e325c5437ee1910ce59ded923343c1cf9ef9ff3c09fd8f630f9f8b1452ecc18</guid></item><item><title>Deep Impact</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mobe1969/deep-impact/#truehd-51</link><description>A seven-mile-wide space rock is hurtling toward Earth, threatening to obliterate the planet.
