The kingdom is deteriorating. People are beginning to act strange... What's even more strange is that people are beginning to see dragons, which shouldn't enter the world of humans. Due to all these bizarre events, Ged, a wandering wizard, is investigating the cause. During his journey, he meets Prince Arren, a young distraught teenage boy. While Arren may look like a shy young teen, he has a severe dark side, which grants him strength, hatred, ruthlessness and has no mercy, especially when it comes to protecting Teru. For the witch Kumo this is a perfect opportunity. She can use the boy's "fears" against the very one who would help him, Ged.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 18:35:16 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>remixmark</category><guid isPermaLink="false">a5ec916d96a025c0f23d489d41fced36fbff9a26d393557f313531798310b4f1</guid></item><item><title>Heretic</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kaelaria/heretic/#dd-atmos</link><description>Two young missionaries are forced to prove their faith when they knock on the wrong door and are greeted by a diabolical Mr. Reed, becoming ensnared in his deadly game of cat-and-mouse.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 16:11:36 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">2dbb035b206675b67ea270cae75737a84acd77a5628c78ea7a8c116a2e721c69</guid></item><item><title>The Convert</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kaelaria/the-convert/#atmos</link><description>Munro, a soldier turned lay preacher, comes to New Zealand to minister to the first British colonists, but he is converted by the powerful chief Maianui to serve a different purpose.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:33:10 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">f354b2cfedbe71d90ba746425b9d2dd94652a2c4d6162279a2a572ecca6a9dc2</guid></item><item><title>Joker: Folie à Deux</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kaelaria/joker-folie-a-deux/#atmos</link><description>While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur Fleck not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:33:10 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">e640cf1adf69a7794f2b88aa727b81d6f52238443d3f2f6e55431f8f74ad83bf</guid></item><item><title>The Polar Express</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixmark/the-polar-express/#dd</link><description>When a doubting young boy takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 01:56:05 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>remixmark</category><guid isPermaLink="false">9024b49672136b52d0fb788e6791d131ce0ddc5f7471055bb83c128c5e248a89</guid></item><item><title>No Country for Old Men</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixmark/no-country-for-old-men/#dts-hd-ma-51</link><description>Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon dead bodies, $2 million and a hoard of heroin in a Texas desert, but methodical killer Anton Chigurh comes looking for it, with local sheriff Ed Tom Bell hot on his trail.
