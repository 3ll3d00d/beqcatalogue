Until now, the run-down apartment block has been considered untouchable to even the bravest of police. Cloaked under the cover of pre-dawn darkness and silence, an elite swat team is tasked with raiding the safe house in order to take down the notorious drug lord that runs it.  But when a chance encounter with a spotter blows their cover and news of their assault reaches the drug lord, the building's lights are cut and all the exits blocked.

Starring Indonesian martial arts sensation Iko Uwais.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 06:29:20 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">a24f3bb6f51cbc033e1727dd3d96d95690f785af36c44587066a8a1fe7c37056</guid></item><item><title>The Accountant²</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/halcyon888/the-accountant2/#dd-atmos</link><description>When an old acquaintance is murdered, Wolff is compelled to solve the case.
