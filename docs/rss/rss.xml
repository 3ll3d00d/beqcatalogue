But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 06:31:39 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">1ca0f0c6286af19fcfee15f630f05273f3cb7032b6754c9648d6700f35ae4324</guid></item><item><title>Cobra</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixmark/cobra/#dts-hd-ma-51</link><description>A tough-on-crime street cop must protect the only surviving witness to a strange murderous cult with far reaching plans.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 22:09:50 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>remixmark</category><guid isPermaLink="false">e41d128f0a5d5fa4e9c34009ebf7eb0a62fbfa4ee1f30402d324ee5f5a43846c</guid></item><item><title>The Boy and the Heron</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixmark/the-boy-and-the-heron/#dd-atmos</link><description>While the Second World War rages, the teenage Mahito, haunted by his mother's tragic death, is relocated from Tokyo to the serene rural home of his new stepmother Natsuko, a woman who bears a striking resemblance to the boy's mother.
