Due to all these bizarre events, Ged, a wandering wizard, is investigating the cause. During his journey, he meets Prince Arren, a young distraught teenage boy. While Arren may look like a shy young teen, he has a severe dark side, which grants him strength, hatred, ruthlessness and has no mercy, especially when it comes to protecting Teru. For the witch Kumo this is a perfect opportunity. She can use the boy's "fears" against the very one who would help him, Ged.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 18:35:16 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>remixmark</category><guid isPermaLink="false">a5ec916d96a025c0f23d489d41fced36fbff9a26d393557f313531798310b4f1</guid></item><item><title>Heretic</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kaelaria/heretic/#dd-atmos</link><description>Two young missionaries are forced to prove their faith when they knock on the wrong door and are greeted by a diabolical Mr. Reed, becoming ensnared in his deadly game of cat-and-mouse.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 16:11:36 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">2dbb035b206675b67ea270cae75737a84acd77a5628c78ea7a8c116a2e721c69</guid></item><item><title>The Convert</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kaelaria/the-convert/#atmos</link><description>Munro, a soldier turned lay preacher, comes to New Zealand to minister to the first British colonists, but he is converted by the powerful chief Maianui to serve a different purpose.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:33:10 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">f354b2cfedbe71d90ba746425b9d2dd94652a2c4d6162279a2a572ecca6a9dc2</guid></item><item><title>Joker: Folie à Deux</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kaelaria/joker-folie-a-deux/#atmos</link><description>While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur Fleck not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 04:33:10 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>kaelaria</category><guid isPermaLink="false">e640cf1adf69a7794f2b88aa727b81d6f52238443d3f2f6e55431f8f74ad83bf</guid></item><item><title>The Polar Express</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixmark/the-polar-express/#dd</link><description>When a doubting young boy takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 01:56:05 -0000</pubDate><category>film</category><category>remixmark</category><guid isPermaLink="false">9024b49672136b52d0fb788e6791d131ce0ddc5f7471055bb83c128c5e248a89</guid></item><item><title>No Country for Old Men</title><link>https://beqcatalogue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixmark/no-country-for-old-men/#dts-hd-ma-51</link><description>Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon dead bodies, $2 million and a hoard of heroin in a Texas desert, but methodical killer Anton Chigurh comes looking for it, with local sheriff Ed Tom Bell hot on his trail.
