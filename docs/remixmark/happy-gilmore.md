Failed hockey player-turned-golf whiz Happy Gilmore — whose unconventional approach and antics on the green courts the ire of rival Shooter McGavin — is determined to win a PGA tournament so he can save his granny's house with the prize money. Meanwhile, an attractive tour publicist tries to soften Happy's image.

**MV Adjustment:** +5.5 dB

Appears to be the same as the 1080P copy. However this was done with the UHD track so I'm adding that note.
