One day, during a university festival where people are often known to find a partner, the 3 incredibly single members of the robot club decide to attend. There the sloppy and timid Hwi-so meets a very aggressive girl by the name of Hye-jin. His romantic advances, which he learned through reading books and watching YouTube, finally wake up to make their move. But will two finally become one this fall?
