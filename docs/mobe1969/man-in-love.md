# Man in Love

## DD+ 5.1

**2021 • 15 • 1h 55m • Mandarin • Romance • mobe1969**

A-Cheng collects debts for a gangster and doesn't skimp on violence, but he can also be merciful to those who deserve it. He has a crush on Hao-ting, the daughter of one of the debtors, but he only knows the underworld and so embarks on a clumsy and primitive courtship that includes reducing the girl's debts in exchange for pity dates. But when Hao-ting catches a glimpse of the good in him, the clouds of melodrama thicken and A-Cheng is forced to come to terms with the real nature of his work.
