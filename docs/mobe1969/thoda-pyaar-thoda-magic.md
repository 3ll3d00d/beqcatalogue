One day they pray to God for help and he does help them. He sends his most mischievous, childlike, lovable angel to the rescue, with a mission to bring Ranbeer and the kids together. Geeta (Rani Mukerji) comes bicycling down a rainbow… and bursts into Ranbeer's house as the selfproclaimed new nanny. And then starts the roller coaster ride of fun, emotions, magic and love.
