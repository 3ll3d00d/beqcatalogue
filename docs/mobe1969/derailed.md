NATO operative Jacques Kristoff (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is summoned into actionâ€”on his birthday, no lessâ€”to track down Galina Konstantin (Laura Harring), who has stolen an extremely valuable and dangerous top-secret container from the Slovakian Government.  Finding Galina doesn't take long, and Jacques must wrap up the mission by returning Galina and the contraband to his superiors by train.  Things seem to be going smoothly as Jacques and Galina board the train posing as a couple, but soon all hell breaks loose.
