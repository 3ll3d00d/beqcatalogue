Roshan Kalra is a three-star Michelin chef who gets fired from New York's Gulli restaurant after he punches a customer. Forced to take a break, he flies to Kochi to spend time with his son, Armaan and his estranged wife Radha Menon. It's a fruitful trip because he manages to mend broken family ties. In a bid to help him get his mojo back, his wife suggests he put up his own food truck and begin afresh.
