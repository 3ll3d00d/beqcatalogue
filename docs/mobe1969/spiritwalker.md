A man loses his memory and wakes up in a new body every 12 hours, each time forced to discover who he is anew. This condition begins when he wakes up in the middle of a car crash, in the body of someone he doesn't recognize, without any knowledge of who he is. He begins to realize that his spirit is stuck to a different body and moves every 12 hours. In his desperate search to find himself, he comes across a woman who claims to recognize him. As he bores deeper into the mystery, he comes across a secretive organization that appears to be chasing him. Before it’s too late, he must find a way back into his own body.
