Kamonmura: a Japanese village shrouded in ethereal night fog. In the mountains nearby where the mysterious "Takigi Noh" ceremony is held, a gigantic garbage landfill towers over the surroundings. Yu Katayama (Ryusei Yokohama), who has lived in Kamonmura since he was a child, works at this waste disposal facility, which sticks out like a sore thumb against the rest of the otherwise beautiful village. He is unable to pay the debts his mother has incurred, and the other workers at the waste disposal facility have their eyes on him, leaving him without hope. Then one day, his childhood friend Misaki returns from Tokyo, and the story begins to take a major turn.
