Confined to an asylum for the criminally insane for the past four years, Nica Pierce is erroneously convinced that she, not Chucky, murdered her entire family. But when her psychiatrist introduces a new therapeutic tool to facilitate his patients group sessions  an all-too-familiar Good Guy doll with an innocently smiling face  a string of grisly deaths begins to plague the asylum, and Nica starts to wonder if maybe she isnt crazy after all. Meanwhile, Andy Barclay, Chuckys now all-grown-up nemesis from the first three Childs Plays, races to Nicas aid. But to save her hell have to get past Tiffany, Chuckys long-ago bride, who will do anything, no matter how deadly or depraved, to help her beloved evil devilish doll.
