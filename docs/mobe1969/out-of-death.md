# Out of Death

## DTS-HD MA 5.1

**2021 • R • 1h 35m • Crime, Adventure, Thriller • mobe1969**

As Shannon, a woman who wants to put her father's ashes away in the woods witnesses a corrupt cop dealing drugs with a junkie, she has to try and run away after she gets rampaged by two discreditable cops after they see her taking secret photographs of their crime maneuver. They then do a cat-and-mouse game around the woods as Shannon teams up with a retired sheriff along the way for more reinforcement. It's just a diversion of survival and egalitarianism.
