# Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

## DTS-HD MA 7.1

Extended Cut

**2004 • R • 1h 28m • Adventure, Comedy • mobe1969**

Nerdy accountant Harold and his irrepressible friend, Kumar, get stoned watching television and find themselves utterly bewitched by a commercial for White Castle. Convinced there must be one nearby, the two set out on a late-night odyssey that takes them deep into New Jersey. Somehow, the boys manage to run afoul of rednecks, cops and even a car-stealing Neil Patrick Harris before getting anywhere near their beloved sliders.
