# Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth

## DD+ 5.1

**True • NR • 1h 41m • Drama, Science Fiction, Animation • mobe1969**

Originally a collection of clips from the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series, Death was created as a precursor to the re-worked ending of the series. Rebirth was intended as that re-worked ending, but after production overruns Rebirth became only the first half of the first part of The End of Evangelion, with some minor differences.
