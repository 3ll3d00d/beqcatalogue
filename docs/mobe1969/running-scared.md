Joey Gazelle is a low level mobster whose job it is to dispose of "hot" guns from mob killings. But Joey has been hiding these guns in the drywall of his basement, instead of tossing them in the river. When Joey's son and his best friend, Oleg, witness Joey hiding some guns from a botched drug deal, Oleg steals one of the guns and shoots his abusive stepfather with it. Things are bad enough, but Oleg's stepfather happens to be the nephew of a psychotic Russian mob boss, who happens to be in business with Joey's crew on a gasoline scam. But now Joey's got a dirty cop from the botched drug deal on his case, not to mention the hot .38 out there on the street. As well as Oleg, who can connect Joey to the gun. And if Joey manages to make it through the night, he's still got to answer to his wife.
