It would appear that Christian and Leonora have it all. They are living the perfect life with their son, who's just been declared healthy after a serious long-term illness. Their future seems bright, but at a party at Christian's company, Leonora sees her husband with a younger woman, architect Xenia. Leonora realizes that Christian might leave her. On the spot, Leonora makes a decision: she refuses to be the woman who got left behind – and will avoid this by any means necessary.
