Veteran cop Nick Pulovski is used to playing musical partners; many of the partners he's had in the past have died on the job, and often as a result of Nick's risky tactics. But the rookie who's been assigned to help Nick bust a carjacking ring is almost as hotheaded as he is Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and when Nick gets kidnapped, his newbie partner is his only hope.
