# Cabin Fever

## DTS-HD MA 5.1

**2016 • NR • 1h 39m • Horror • mobe1969**

In this grisly remake of the 2002 horror hit, five college chums rent an isolated woodland cabin for a party. But their fun quickly ends when the group is exposed to a hideous flesh-eating virus, and survival becomes the name of the game.
