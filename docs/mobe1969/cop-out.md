# Cop Out

## DTS-HD MA 5.1

**2010 • R • 1h 47m • Action, Comedy, Crime • mobe1969**

Detectives Jimmy and Paul, despite nine years as partners, can still sometimes seem like polar oppositesâ€”especially when Paul's unpredictable antics get them suspended without pay. Already strapped for cash and trying to pay for his daughter's wedding, Jimmy decides to sell a rare baseball card that's worth tens of thousands. Unfortunately, when the collector's shop is robbed and the card vanishes with the crook, Paul and Jimmy end up going rogue, tracking down the card and the drug ring behind its theft, all on their own time and without any backupâ€”except for each other.
