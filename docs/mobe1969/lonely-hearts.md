Based on a true story. . . . In the late 1940s, Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez were America’s notorious “Lonely Hearts Killers.” Their lethal scam was simple; they would swindle and then viciously murder lovelorn war widows who would answer their personal ads in which Ray would describe himself as a sexy Latin lover.
