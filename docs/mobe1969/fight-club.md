# Fight Club

## DTS-HD MA 5.1

**1999 • R • 2h 19m • Drama • mobe1969**

A ticking-time-bomb insomniac and a slippery soap salesman channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground "fight clubs" forming in every town, until an eccentric gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.
