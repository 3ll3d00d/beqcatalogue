Following a nuclear power plant meltdown, a nearby village known as Nosferatu Village, became radiated, and subsequently abandoned for more than a decade. The year is 1984, and the public are now permitted to return, and a small group come back to their family home to discover a radiated bat living in their attic. The family must survive the night to escape, but the monster has other plans as they soon begin to find themselves infected with a deadly plague that will kill them if the beast doesn't. Waiting for sun to rise, they must figure a way to survive the night, battling against the creature.
