Maryam and Nasser are set to travel from Riyadh to attend their father’s wedding in Abu Dhabi, until the flight is cancelled. Undaunted, they decide to make the journey by car instead. Their time together will mend a relationship that has frayed since their mother’s death as they share their feelings about their overbearing father––but, they underestimate the many hazards of the desert road, including an angry stranger whose terrifying pursuit has the brother and sister driving for their lives.
