Rishi is a writer/director who is narrating a script close to his heart to Rohini - possibly the lead protagonist of his film. As he begins his narration, we step into the world of Rahul, Riya, Rambo and Raju - four friends living their best days amusing people with childish shenanigans in school.  These four "Vellas" are complete and content with each other's company and couldn't care less about the world around them until life hits them in the face. An enthralling script narration on one end, and four immature kids trying to correct a plan gone wrong on the other - Velle is about laughter, friendships, frenzy and the unpredictability of life.
