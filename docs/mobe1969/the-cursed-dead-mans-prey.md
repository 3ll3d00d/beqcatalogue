In this movie spinoff of "The Cursed", reporter Im Jin-Hee receives a mysterious call while on a live radio program - the strange voice warning her about a murder happening soon. After the call, people begin to be murdered left and right. The murderers are "jaechaui" - corpses that can walk and talk like just like humans. One thing separates them from humans, though: they are just puppets being manipulated by someone far scarier than themselves.
