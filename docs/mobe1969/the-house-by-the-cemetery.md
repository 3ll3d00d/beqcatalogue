A young family moves from their cramped New York City apartment to a spacious new home in New England.  But his is no ordinary house in the country:  the previous owner was the deranged Dr. Freudstein, whose monstrous human experiments have left a legacy of bloody mayhem.  Now, someone - or something - is alive in the basement, and home sweet home is about to become a horrific hell on earth.
