Country star Colt Ford brings his hard rockin' set to his rabid fans at the Wild Adventures Theme Park in Valdosta, Georgia. See and hear Colt and his band perform an electrifying high-energy show, spotlighting tracks from over the course of his entire career. The Colt Ford faithful cranked up the energy to a whole new level when a torrential downpour soaked the crowd, bringing the back half of the set to a wild finish! So Crank It Up!
