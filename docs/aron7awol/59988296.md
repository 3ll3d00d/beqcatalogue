# Coma

## DTS-HD MA 5.1

**2019 • 1h 51m • Russian • Fantasy, Science Fiction, Action • aron7awol**

A young and talented architect comes to his senses after a horrific accident only to find himself in the odd dystopian world. A world that is filled with the memories of all current coma patients. Just like a human memory this world is fragmental, chaotic and unstable. This is COMA: icecaps, rivers and cities can all exist in a space of a single room and laws of physics are no longer laws as they can be bent.
