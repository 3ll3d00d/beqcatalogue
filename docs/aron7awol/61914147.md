# Top Gun: Maverick

## DD+ Atmos

**2022 • PG-13 • 2h 11m • Drama, Action • aron7awol**

After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators, and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell finds himself training a detachment of TOP GUN graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen.

**MV Adjustment:** -4.0 dB

I recommend a +7dB MV adjustment and a -7dB mDSP input adjustment on top of this, to still end up with what's shows on the graph in the sub range but to get the dialogue and treble up to what's more like normal reference level.
